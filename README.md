# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Project assignment for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" as part of the Data Science Specialisation

This repository contains the R code and documentation files submitted for the Coursera Geting and Cleaning Data course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare
tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project requier the submission of: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository containing script for performing the analysis,
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

The data used fot this assignment is from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". The data sets used
can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The code provided in this repository assumes that the data has been downloaded and un=compressed from the avove link
and that theye are present in their original folers, stored in the working directory.

The files presented in this repository consist of:
1) CodeBook.md, which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
2) run_analysis.R, which contains all of the code needed to perform the analyses described. 
3) averages_data.txt which holds the output from running the code presented in run_analysis.R
